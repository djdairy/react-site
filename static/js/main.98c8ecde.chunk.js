Perhaps it is more appropriate to say he is woken up, as, without the assistance of his deafeningly loud alarm clock radio it seems probable that Dustin may have enjoyed a few more hours of peaceful slumber. Though I suppose it is unimportant, what is important is that Dustin wakes up. His bedroom is lit dimly by not only the sun reaching coyly under his curtains but also by the tiny coloured LED lights of various devices haphazardly strewn about the room. Dustin moves quickly to silence the piercing, shrieking of his alarm clock and with continuing swiftness casts aside his covers and lays his feet on the nicely heated bedroom floor. He stands up sharply and begins to approach the largest collection of tiny coloured LED lights in the room. Mid stride, he mutters \u201clights\u201d. Though his inflection is frail, his utterance is just enough to be registered as audible and understandable by his home maintenance and security system which, though is obviously pretty high tech and expensive and all that, still hasn\u2019t figured out what a dimmer switch is as it illuminates the room with a burst of light so bright the sun would be jealous. Dustin stops dead in his tracks, scrunching his face up and covering his eyes with his hands. There are some things, it seems, you just can\u2019t get used to. With the brilliant light now shining clarity down onto the room it is apparent that the assemblage of LEDs which Dustin was until just moments ago sluggishly approaching, is in fact his desk.

Perhaps the shocking brightness of the light has jostled him awake, or perhaps he simply feels more comfortable walking with the lights on, knowing that he is far less likely to stub his toe on the furniture. Dustin carefully opens up his laptop and inputs his password to login. It is only eight characters, alphanumeric and does not appear to include any capital letters, Dustin should be more conscientious of his e-security. As the laptop loads up Dustin checks his phone. There are no new messages, though it has nearly finished charging. He next lazily prods his tablet, waking it up and navigating to the calendar app. It is a Thursday and it seems all he has scheduled today is work, which begins in about three hours. Dustin does not seem surprised by this but he does sigh, it appears he was hopeful that somehow work would not have been on the agenda today. Quickly scanning other non-work days on the calendar it seems as though he would not have had anything to do if it wasn\u2019t. The laptop has now finished booting and Dustin immediately uses it to check his email. This task could have easily been achieved on either of the two previous devices but it seems that this is how Dustin rolls. Dustin briefly scans his emails which seem to mostly be from various online retail stores as well as a couple from science and technology publications. Clearly nothing is of too much interest as as quickly as Dustin opened the laptop he shuts it, heading out of his bedroom through the faux wooden door into his small, but still fairly luxurious en suite bathroom."),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"pageIndicator"},o.a.createElement("p",null,"1.")))}function D(){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"contentArea"},o.a.createElement("h2",null,"Dustin's Story"),o.a.createElement("h2",null,"Chapter 1"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"The bathroom is as brilliantly illuminated as the bedroom the second he walks in, though the \u201ceverything in the bathroom should be white\u201d decor which Dustin seems to abide by makes the room feel somehow even brighter.

He sets the shower going at what looks like a fairly reasonable temperature before tossing his clothes, what appear to be yesterday\u2019s underwear and an old, overused, under washed t-shirt on to the floor. He steps into the bath-shower combination unit and pulls across a transparent plastic screen to prevent splashing water all over the rather cosy bathroom. Dustin does not seem to be one for singing in the shower though he does emit the odd grunt and groan as he washes the more hard to reach areas of his body. Dustin is not an old man and such grumblings are probably unnecessary, perhaps he just likes to complain. The shower turns off. Dustin pushes back the protective screen, now no longer transparent but opaque with condensation and reaches out of the bath-shower combination unit towards a pristine white towel which adorns a chrome towel rack fastened to the white tiled wall.

It seems that he was not addled by sleep when he first spoke this morning and that this is just the way Dustin speaks, as though he does not do so so often and has not had much practice. A whirr, a thud and a clunk emit from the wash basket as a panel in its base opens to allow the dirty laundry to fall into the washing machine below before shutting again, ready to catch any more dirty clothes that Dustin may choose to toss its way.

In his living room a large screen comes alive with light and sound. The screen is displaying the morning newscast in, of course, short five minute segments fragmented by advert after advert. Sometimes it is a little hard to tell what is an advert and what is the news. Such is the way of television these days. Though he has turned the thing on Dustin seems to pay absolutely no mind to the screen or the drivel emanating from it, I suppose he just wants to fill the silence. With the television creating some background ambience Dustin seems a little more at ease. He moves to pick up his kettle, probably the only object on this floor of the apartment that shows any wear. He fills it from the dedicated drinking water spout which sits adjacent to his stainless steel tap before setting it to boil. As it is boiling Dustin takes a chrome vacuum flask from one of the kitchen cupboards and from another cupboard takes a jar of granulated coffee. He pours an absurdly large amount of coffee granules into the flask before replacing the jar. The kettle is still boiling as Dustin pulls open a drawer and retrieves a small plastic, safety capped bottle of vitamins. This bottle has a lovely little picture of the sun on it and is labelled \u2018vitamin D\u2019. Seeing as the badge on Dustin\u2019s uniform reads \u2018Underground Maintenance\u2019 it is likely that he does not see much of the sun, so the vitamin D supplements are probably vital for ensuring a healthy body and a healthy mind. Good job, Dustin. Dustin quickly opens the bottle and swallows a tablet as the kettle comes to boil. He puts the vitamins away before filling the vacuum flask to the brim with the boiling water. Due to the absurd amount of coffee which Dustin had already dumped into the flask it is not all immediately dissolved, many of the coffee granules float to the surface of the flask creating a rather disgusting looking lumpy brown concoction.

Dustin still does not appear to be paying any mind to whatever babble the television is spouting but his eyes seem intently fixed on the bottom right hand corner of the screen where there is displayed a tiny digital clock. As the number representing minutes ticks up by one Dustin takes his chrome flask from the kitchen counter and proceeds towards the front door of his apartment.

It wasn\u2019t long ago that people still drove themselves around in their own privately owned cars but with the number of human drivers on the road decreasing and the only road traffic accidents being caused being caused by human drivers the government, in collaboration with ThinkCom\u2122, instigated a ban on all privately owned cars and created what we know today as personal transport vehicles. In truth it was a system which many had already adopted, a group of people whose schedules were all different would get together to purchase and run a self driving car. The car would then spend its time servicing the needs of all its owners. To each owner it was just like having their own car, it was always there when they needed it but they could buy and run it at a fraction of the cost. This self-driving car-share system also had a tremendous impact on the state of the roads, congestion and the environment, all things the government loved pointing out when they made this system compulsory nationwide. Being powered by the tech powerhouse ThinkCom\u2122\u2019s incredible algorithms it was actually rather simple to figure out the schedules of everyone in the country and find personal transport vehicles to suit their needs, so simple in fact that the system only took about two weeks to implement. In order to really sell this idea to the people, particularly the people who thought this sort of thing was a declaration of war on personal freedom, the government announced that this service would be absolutely free and that those who had already opted into this scheme would be receiving a small tax refund.

Rude people might call her a jumped up travel agent, but she does much more than that. When some rich businessman from the UAE or China or the US comes to visit the UK, Ms Tierney is the woman they seek. Her most recent clients, a couple from Korea (she never did find out which one), had requested to spend their nights in Kensington Palace, their days escorted by the Queen\u2019s guard and they also wanted private access to many of London\u2019s famous attractions. Ms. Tierney went above and beyond. The couple ate dinner with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, were driven in a limo by a member of the Queen\u2019s guard who also acted as a tour guide, explaining the rich histories of all of London\u2019s most famous sites, which on those days just so happened to be closed to the general public for maintenance.\xa0"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Such a feat did not come overnight.

Francesca decided to take the job, despite its simplicity, not only as she saw it as an in to the rather lucrative world of art, but also because the painter immediately accepted her initial invoice. Her initial invoice, of course, is always something of a bartering trick. Featuring many obscene expenses, always grossly overpriced, it\u2019s more of a feeler to see just how rich her clients are. There have not been many occasions where a client has simply accepted her first quote, but it seems Quincy McMadden is an exceedingly successful painter. The most difficult and truly expensive part of McMadden\u2019s request was the procurement of several varieties of bespoke paints to be ready for him upon his arrival. Oils, acrylics, watercolours and even pastels, all specially designed by several different craftsmen for Mr McMadden. Then there was the canvases, an unthinkable number, various shapes and sizes, but at least it explained all the paint. After that, Francesca had erected a hide in the hills near Milner\u2019s Tower, providing 360degree views of a truly beautiful part of the world. McMadden has insisted he wanted to paint in all weathers to capture the true beauty of the old country. The hide is rather luxurious, featuring a bathroom, a kitchenette, an actual bed, storage for the incredible volume of canvas, and a drying area which has some sort of intricate airflow designed to help paintings dry quicker.

Quincy McMadden, however, intends to remain in his hide painting for two months. What this means for Francesca, or at least what it has meant so far, is that for two months she is essentially an incredibly expensive food delivery service.
