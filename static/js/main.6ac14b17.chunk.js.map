Perhaps it is more appropriate to say he is woken up, as, without the assistance of his deafeningly loud alarm clock radio it seems probable that Dustin may have enjoyed a few more hours of peaceful slumber. Though I suppose it is unimportant, what is important is that Dustin wakes up. His bedroom is lit dimly by not only the sun reaching coyly under his curtains but also by the tiny coloured LED lights of various devices haphazardly strewn about the room. Dustin moves quickly to silence the piercing, shrieking of his alarm clock and with continuing swiftness casts aside his covers and lays his feet on the nicely heated bedroom floor. He stands up sharply and begins to approach the largest collection of tiny coloured LED lights in the room. Mid stride, he mutters “lights”. Though his inflection is frail, his utterance is just enough to be registered as audible and understandable by his home maintenance and security system which, though is obviously pretty high tech and expensive and all that, still hasn’t figured out what a dimmer switch is as it illuminates the room with a burst of light so bright the sun would be jealous. Dustin stops dead in his tracks, scrunching his face up and covering his eyes with his hands. There are some things, it seems, you just can’t get used to. With the brilliant light now shining clarity down onto the room it is apparent that the assemblage of LEDs which Dustin was until just moments ago sluggishly approaching, is in fact his desk. On it sits a laptop computer, closed, with:</p>\n            <p>One orange LED, stable, one green LED, stable, and one green LED, flashing intermittently. </p>\n            <p>To the left of the laptop sits a tablet:</p>\n            <p>Single blue led, strobing from completely on to not quite off.</p>\n            <p>Finally, on the far left sits his mobile phone:</p>\n            <p>Single orange led, stable.</p>\n            <p>Dustin regains his composure and once again heads towards his desk, this time there is a lot more confidence in his stride. Perhaps the shocking brightness of the light has jostled him awake, or perhaps he simply feels more comfortable walking with the lights on, knowing that he is far less likely to stub his toe on the furniture. Dustin carefully opens up his laptop and inputs his password to login. It is only eight characters, alphanumeric and does not appear to include any capital letters, Dustin should be more conscientious of his e-security. As the laptop loads up Dustin checks his phone. There are no new messages, though it has nearly finished charging. He next lazily prods his tablet, waking it up and navigating to the calendar app. It is a Thursday and it seems all he has scheduled today is work, which begins in about three hours. Dustin does not seem surprised by this but he does sigh, it appears he was hopeful that somehow work would not have been on the agenda today. Quickly scanning other non-work days on the calendar it seems as though he would not have had anything to do if it wasn’t. The laptop has now finished booting and Dustin immediately uses it to check his email. This task could have easily been achieved on either of the two previous devices but it seems that this is how Dustin rolls. Dustin briefly scans his emails which seem to mostly be from various online retail stores as well as a couple from science and technology publications. Clearly nothing is of too much interest as as quickly as Dustin opened the laptop he shuts it, heading out of his bedroom through the faux wooden door into his small, but still fairly luxurious en suite bathroom.</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>1.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function DsTwo() {\n    return (\n        \n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Dustin's Story</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>\n            <p>The bathroom is as brilliantly illuminated as the bedroom the second he walks in, though the “everything in the bathroom should be white” decor which Dustin seems to abide by makes the room feel somehow even brighter. Light seems to bounce off the white tiles ricochet off the white toilet seat and deflect off the white sink into the white bath-shower combination unit which Dustin is now playing with. He sets the shower going at what looks like a fairly reasonable temperature before tossing his clothes, what appear to be yesterday’s underwear and an old, overused, under washed t-shirt on to the floor. He steps into the bath-shower combination unit and pulls across a transparent plastic screen to prevent splashing water all over the rather cosy bathroom. Dustin does not seem to be one for singing in the shower though he does emit the odd grunt and groan as he washes the more hard to reach areas of his body. Dustin is not an old man and such grumblings are probably unnecessary, perhaps he just likes to complain. The shower turns off. Dustin pushes back the protective screen, now no longer transparent but opaque with condensation and reaches out of the bath-shower combination unit towards a pristine white towel which adorns a chrome towel rack fastened to the white tiled wall. With the towel he brushes off any large droplets of water which cling to his pale skin before stepping out of the bath-shower combination unit and wrapping it about his waist. As he moves to leave the bathroom he stoops down to collect his dirty clothes.\n</p>\n<p>Upon re-entering his bedroom Dustin throws his used clothes expertly into what we can assume to be a wash basket. He then unties the towel from around his waist and after firmly passing it over his body a few more times also tosses the still pristine white, if now slightly damp, towel into the wash basket. “Please clean” Dustin mutters with the same frail inflection as before. It seems that he was not addled by sleep when he first spoke this morning and that this is just the way Dustin speaks, as though he does not do so so often and has not had much practice. A whirr, a thud and a clunk emit from the wash basket as a panel in its base opens to allow the dirty laundry to fall into the washing machine below before shutting again, ready to catch any more dirty clothes that Dustin may choose to toss its way. A beautifully synthesized but still clearly robotic voice speaks, seemingly from the walls of the bedroom. \n</p>\n<p>“Clothes will be clean and ready to wear in approximately 31 minutes.”\n</p>\n<p>The tone of the home maintenance and security system, which is of course the source of the voice, is cheerful, upbeat and clear, a stark contrast to its owner’s rather more raspy enunciation. Dustin approaches his wardrobe, a rather stylish piece of furniture and from it takes what seemingly will be the day’s clothes, his work uniform. The uniform in question is a rather dull brown one piece jumpsuit emblazoned with the ‘Electrocity’ logo on the right shoulder and to the lapel there is affixed a badge which reads ‘Underground Maintenance’. Though certainly lacking in the fashion department the uniform fits Dustin very well and makes him look a lot more fit than he actually is. After getting dressed Dustin collects his phone from his desk before moving to the corner of his bedroom and stepping onto a lift pad. When both feet are firmly planted, the lift pad begins to slowly lower Dustin down into the rest of his apartment.\n</p>\n<p>Dustin waits for the lift pad to come to a complete stop before stepping off into his living room, or is it his kitchen? The lower floor of his apartment is open plan, it is hard to know where you draw the line between different rooms. This floor of Dustin’s apartment appears immaculate, not as though it is well kept but more as though it is unused. The cushions which adorn his real leather three piece suite are creaseless and perfectly placed, the leather itself is in perfect condition, its soft but firm surface revealing not a hint of dirt. In the kitchen pristine tiled surfaces shine under the incredible indoor lighting and the oven looks so clean you could eat off it. It is clear Dustin is not much of a chef.\n</p>\n<div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>2.</p></div>\n\n        </div>\n                              \n                               \n\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function DsThree() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Dustin's Story</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <p>Dustin steps towards the kitchen and approaches one of the of shining tile topped counters, from its surface he takes what appears to be a television remote control. In his living room a large screen comes alive with light and sound. The screen is displaying the morning newscast in, of course, short five minute segments fragmented by advert after advert. Sometimes it is a little hard to tell what is an advert and what is the news. Such is the way of television these days. Though he has turned the thing on Dustin seems to pay absolutely no mind to the screen or the drivel emanating from it, I suppose he just wants to fill the silence. With the television creating some background ambience Dustin seems a little more at ease. He moves to pick up his kettle, probably the only object on this floor of the apartment that shows any wear. He fills it from the dedicated drinking water spout which sits adjacent to his stainless steel tap before setting it to boil. As it is boiling Dustin takes a chrome vacuum flask from one of the kitchen cupboards and from another cupboard takes a jar of granulated coffee. He pours an absurdly large amount of coffee granules into the flask before replacing the jar. The kettle is still boiling as Dustin pulls open a drawer and retrieves a small plastic, safety capped bottle of vitamins. This bottle has a lovely little picture of the sun on it and is labelled ‘vitamin D’. Seeing as the badge on Dustin’s uniform reads ‘Underground Maintenance’ it is likely that he does not see much of the sun, so the vitamin D supplements are probably vital for ensuring a healthy body and a healthy mind. Good job, Dustin. Dustin quickly opens the bottle and swallows a tablet as the kettle comes to boil. He puts the vitamins away before filling the vacuum flask to the brim with the boiling water. Due to the absurd amount of coffee which Dustin had already dumped into the flask it is not all immediately dissolved, many of the coffee granules float to the surface of the flask creating a rather disgusting looking lumpy brown concoction. Dustin does not seem phased by this at all as he fastens the flask closed and gives it a quick shake before leaving it to stand on one of the tiled kitchen counters.</p> \n            <p>Dustin, for the first time since turning it on, glances briefly at the screen in the living room. If I had to guess I’d say right now it was displaying an advertisement for the latest brilliant gadget which solves all the problems of day to day life which we never even knew existed. Though as I said before it could of course be a news report, an “advertorial”, about the same gadget. Dustin still does not appear to be paying any mind to whatever babble the television is spouting but his eyes seem intently fixed on the bottom right hand corner of the screen where there is displayed a tiny digital clock. As the number representing minutes ticks up by one Dustin takes his chrome flask from the kitchen counter and proceeds towards the front door of his apartment. He disengages the lock, opens the door and as he steps out into the hallway Dustin mutters, as inaudibly as ever, “off”. The television and lights immediately relent their exhausting pressure upon the apartment returning it to a state of near darkness and silence lit now only by the sun’s lame attempts to breach the curtains and the countless tiny LED lights scattered about the rooms.\n</p>           \n<div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>3.</p></div>\n\n        </div>\n\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function DsFour() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Dustin's Story</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 1 Addendum.</h2>\n            <p>Electrocity is the name of the private company entrusted by the government to deliver cheap, safe and clean electricity to every man woman and child in the country. The company has been managing this feat, more or less perfectly, for a few decades now thanks in no small part to its 90% synthetic workforce. This is of course not uncommon these days, most major companies have a workforce which is at least 80% synthetic. It simply makes more sense from an economical standpoint, it costs far less in energy bills and robot tax to run a machine than it does to pay a human being’s wage. Generally the only human jobs which are available at these companies are maintenance jobs. People are needed to keep all the machinery, which is doing all the work, in top shape and this is of course what Dustin does. Dustin specifically works in the underground maintenance department which means he has to maintain all sorts of horribly fiddly little machines which I really don’t understand but have been assured are vitally important for making sure it’s possible for me, as an individual, to be able to tap my television remote control of a morning and watch my favourite morning advertisements. To say Dustin’s job is important would be an overstatement. The day to day maintenance of the underground machines, even in the large area in which Dustin operates, is fairly unnecessary as they are very well built and have a failure rate of only 1% over a period of 20 years. The reason for Dustin’s employment by Electrocity is to ensure that that 1% failure rate drops. If it does the company stands to receive some rather disgusting tax breaks and the higher ups in the company stand to receive some even more disgusting bonuses.</p>\n            <p>Dustin works alone, just like everyone else who works in maintenance for Electrocity. He covers a rather large part of the city’s underground electric network and takes his job very seriously. I think he may even enjoy it. Every maintenance worker for Electrocity covers a large area of their particular network, each person’s area overlapping with at least two others. This ensures that machines are checked thoroughly and by different eyes giving the best possible chance for the discovery of any errors. Though their zones overlap the maintenance workers will never meet as it is scheduled so that only one worker will be in one place at one time. Such ruthless efficiency is most likely the work of a rather superb administrative robot.</p>\n\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>4.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function DsFive() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Dustin's Story</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 2.</h2>\n            <p>Dustin steps out of his apartment building almost exactly as his personal transport vehicle arrives. Its door automatically opens and welcomes Dustin inside. Dustin climbs in and lowers himself gently onto one of the faux leather seats. As soon as Dustin is sitting, seemingly comfortably, a screen illuminates right in front of his eyes and begins blaring adverts at him. Dustin sighs as he looks around the interior of the vehicle. Wherever his eyes go adverts seem to follow. Dustin seems to give up as he stares at the screen for the remainder of his 20 minute commute to work.\n</p>\n            <p>The personal transport vehicle, after what for Dustin must feel like a lifetime of adverts, finally comes to a stop. Dustin steps out of the vehicle and firmly shuts the door behind him. As soon as the door clicks shut the vehicle begins driving again, off to its next unlucky passenger. The street Dustin stands on is empty and spotless. It is probable that the last person to come to this particular street was another maintenance worker, just like Dustin, who, also like Dustin, would not spend more than 30 seconds on the surface. Dustin immediately steps into the underground access lift which stands unimposingly before him. Dustin places his thumb on a fingerprint scanner and submits one of his light brown eyes for a retinal check. As the lift beeps in acceptance Dustin bumps the “M” button on the lift’s panel with his fist and the lift begins its descent.\n</p>\n            <p>The lift comes to a stop, its harsh, heavy steel doors open slowly revealing a dimly lit, grubby, warm, damp and smelly corridor. Dustin does not seem at all phased by this as he walks confidently, into the passageway. Metal code locked doors are scattered along both walls of the corridor. Dustin approaches the nearest door, the first on his left and inputs a code. It is 16 characters, containing alphanumeric symbols as well as special characters and capital letters. Now that is e-security. The door slides open allowing Dustin inside. The small room which Dustin now enters, whilst still dimly lit, is not at all damp, there seems to be a complete lack of any humidity. The incredible air conditioning also seems to be keeping the room Arctic cool, it is so cold, in fact, that Dustin’s breath is clearly visible as he exhales. Dustin takes a seat on a plain wooden chair which sits in front of a fairly standard looking computer terminal on fairly standard looking desk. As Dustin activates the terminal by shaking the mouse a few times a brilliant light, much like the one in Dustin’s apartment, illuminates the small room and reveals the back wall of the room to not be a wall at all. The back wall of the room is actually giant circuit board. A giant super complicated looking circuit board. After pressing a few buttons on the computer, setting a diagnostic program to run, Dustin gets out of the chair and walks to the back of the room. He thoroughly examines every inch of the circuit board before returning to the terminal to see the results. There are zero errors reported by the computer and it seems Dustin agrees as he puts the computer to sleep and exits the room, back into the stifling warmth of the dirty, stinky, dark corridor. Dustin approaches the next door and repeats this process for the rest of the day.\n</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>5.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function DsSix() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Dustin's Story</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 2.</h2>\n            <p>The end of the work day is signified to Dustin by a small vibration in his back left pocket. Dustin’s mobile phone gently shakes and lets out a faint murmur. Dustin quickly finishes up what he is doing, sealing the door of a room he has just serviced, before silencing his phone. Dustin is now at the opposite end of the incredibly long corridor in which he had begun his working day. Fortunately it seems he does not have to make a long trek back up the corridor in order to take a lift to the surface as he taps what looks like a lift call button on the grubby damp wall which is probably grubbier and damper at this end of the corridor. After a brief wait the lift arrives and welcomes Dustin inside. Dustin once again submits to a retinal and fingerprint scan in order to get the lift to take him where he wants to go, the surface. Exiting the lift Dustin enters what would be another beautifully clean and completely empty street were it not for his personal transport vehicle, which has seemingly has just arrived, its door open, inviting him in.\n</p>\n            <p>The personal transport vehicle does not take Dustin directly home, it stops briefly by a line of vending machines and waits whilst Dustin selects his dinner from what is seemingly the most well used machine in the line. The food pops out of the machine’s opening on almost the same second that Dustin presses the button. Now that’s fast food. The dinner is neatly packaged in a recyclable cardboard box. Printed on the side of the box is the name of the meal Dustin has selected, “ramen meal number six”, and of course the vending machine’s brand, “MaMa’s Good Noodle”, a subsidiary of ThinkCom™. Upon collecting his dinner Dustin re-enters his personal transport vehicle which now drives him home as he slurps ramen meal number six and watches advertisements for various insomnia cures and dating websites. Dustin arrives home well fed and seemingly ready for bed as he yawns and stretches stepping out of his personal transport vehicle into his apartment building.\n</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>6.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function DsSeven() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Dustin's Story</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 2 Addendum.</h2>\n            <p>Personal transport vehicles are the final realisation of self-driving car technology. It wasn’t long ago that people still drove themselves around in their own privately owned cars but with the number of human drivers on the road decreasing and the only road traffic accidents being caused being caused by human drivers the government, in collaboration with ThinkCom™, instigated a ban on all privately owned cars and created what we know today as personal transport vehicles. In truth it was a system which many had already adopted, a group of people whose schedules were all different would get together to purchase and run a self driving car. The car would then spend its time servicing the needs of all its owners. To each owner it was just like having their own car, it was always there when they needed it but they could buy and run it at a fraction of the cost. This self-driving car-share system also had a tremendous impact on the state of the roads, congestion and the environment, all things the government loved pointing out when they made this system compulsory nationwide. Being powered by the tech powerhouse ThinkCom™’s incredible algorithms it was actually rather simple to figure out the schedules of everyone in the country and find personal transport vehicles to suit their needs, so simple in fact that the system only took about two weeks to implement. In order to really sell this idea to the people, particularly the people who thought this sort of thing was a declaration of war on personal freedom, the government announced that this service would be absolutely free and that those who had already opted into this scheme would be receiving a small tax refund. In order to pay for this obviously extremely expensive system the government turned every square inch of every single personal transport vehicle into advertising space and sold it to the highest bidder.\n</p>\n            <p>Advertisements have for a long time been catered to our specific interests but never quite so excellently as they are today. Thanks to incredible advancements in ThinkCom™‘s extremely invasive algorithms adverts these days try to anticipate not only exactly what you need but exactly what you need exactly when you need it. As our schedules are well known by the algorithm the system knows what times we are likely to be hungry and so can correctly hit us with food adverts when we are at our most vulnerable. Is your phone’s battery lasting less and less time each time you charge it? The system knows, whenever you’re running low on battery you’ll start to see adverts for new wonderful replacement phones which will solve all your problems. Did a home appliance break? Thanks to ThinkCom™‘s integration with most home maintenance and security systems the system knows that too! So if your dishwasher breaks expect to see a lot of adverts for dishwashers or dishwasher repair kits. Thanks to most modern technology’s attempts to be personalised and of course their reliance on ThinkCom™‘s amazing open source code these adverts can also target you on almost any platform. From the television in your house to your phone to your laptop to the screen in your personal transport vehicle to electric billboards, if an advertisement display surface can recognise you, or knows you’ll be able to see it at a certain time it will adapt its display to best cater to you. Thanks ThinkCom™.\n</p>\n            <p>With automation replacing the entire workforce of most fast food restaurants many fast food chains began abandoning the restaurant idea entirely. Paying the lease or business rent on a commercial building just wasn’t worth it. People didn’t sit down to eat in fast food restaurants, they bought their food and they went about their business, taking their food with them wherever they were going. The downsizing of fast food restaurants happened fairly quickly. First they became street vendors, with the robot chefs visible to all. Though this proved popular at first, it unnerved some people who didn’t like the idea of knife wielding robots being out in a public space. After a couple of accidents and a couple of lawsuits, involving the aforementioned knives, the fast food chains began covering the pseudo-kitchens and having the robot chefs pass the completed meals through a hatch. It’s worth noting that any harm caused by the robot chefs to humans was entirely due to human error but nonetheless for the safety of the general public, who clearly have no idea how to take care of themselves, and for the safety of the fast food chains who were frankly quite sick of having to write out of court settlement cheques, the covering of the robots was deemed necessary. Miniaturization followed, reducing the size of the fast food street vendor boxes to the size of mere vending machines. Fast food is now faster and more convenient than ever.\n</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>7.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function DsEight() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Dustin's Story</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 3.</h2>\n            <p>Dustin wakes up. Today there is no piercing, shrieking sounding from his alarm clock, it seems that Dustin has enjoyed enough peaceful slumber. Though he is now most certainly awake, this morning Dustin does not move with the swiftness of the day before. Dustin stays still in bed, eyes wide open, perhaps adjusting to the low light of the room. The sun’s attempts to breach the curtains are particularly fierce today, most of the furniture and objects which decorate Dustin’s bedroom are fairly easy to make out. Dustin lies still for several minutes before stretching, throwing off his duvet and stepping out of bed onto the nicely heated bedroom floor. Dustin does not call for lights today, he strides confidently towards his desk. This time, however, upon reaching his desk Dustin pulls out a small wooden chair from beneath its surface. The chair is adorned with a rather dirty, well used looking cushion. Dustin promptly takes a seat. Dustin opens his laptop and proceeds to log-in, just as he had done the day before. As the laptop boots he checks his phone for messages, there are still none, and he checks his calendar on his tablet. Today, it seems, there are no plans. Dustin then completes his morning ritual by checking his e-mails on his laptop, the content of which has changed little from the previous day, however this morning Dustin decides to scan the contents of a few of the science and technology e-mails.\n</p>\n<p>Dustin has been sitting in front of his laptop for some time now. He has barely moved a muscle. His laptop is equipped with one of those awfully fancy eye movement recognition cursors so there is no need for Dustin to operate a mouse to navigate his machine. He occasionally raises his hands to type something but he more or less sits completely still, arms folded, staring and blinking at the screen. Dustin has been mostly reading the week’s news articles and advertorials, which, of course, to most are completely indistinguishable. Dustin is currently reading an advertorial about the latest conversational artificial intelligence which, it seems, has recently been installed in a selection of robots manufactured by Human Robotics. I sincerely hope Dustin realises this article contains absolutely no journalistic integrity and that it is just trying to sell this terrifying new product. Before Dustin can finish reading the advertorial a loud “ding” and a loud “dong” emit from the walls of his apartment. “Who is it?” Dustin mutters. “It’s your 4 o’clock cleaner, shall I let him in?” replies the home maintenance and security system. “N-no” stammers Dustin, “I’ll let him in”. “You got it!” exclaims the home maintenance and security system, in an almost dejected tone.\n</p>\n<p>Dustin stretches and groans as he rises from his chair. He had been sitting, almost motionless, for hours which may explain his uneasiness on his feet as he steps on to the lift pad to be lowered to the ground floor of his apartment. Still not dressed, wearing only yesterday’s underwear, Dustin moves to the front door of his apartment, disengages the lock and welcomes his cleaner inside. The cleaner, a SuperVac-MegaClean 2.0 greats Dustin in the usual manner befitting of a machine built to do one job exceptionally well but not built to do anything else “Hello. Sir. Or. Madam.” the robot whirs metallically, “I. Am. Here. To. Clean.”. “Yes” sighs Dustin, “Thank you.” Having allowed the robot inside Dustin shuts and locks his front door before returning to his position, sitting in front of his laptop. The faint sounds of the SuperVac-MegaClean 2.0 can be heard below as Dustin resumes perusing the week’s events.</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>8.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function DsNine() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Dustin's Story</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 3.</h2>\n            <p>I’d like to tell you more about Dustin’s day off but quite frankly I’ve told you enough already. I’m almost falling asleep watching him. He’s just sitting in his chair browsing the internet. Were I narrating the adventures of the cleaning robot, the SuperVac-MegaClean 2.0, I may be able to tell you of some exciting discoveries it mindlessly cleans away. Were I narrating the journeys of Dustin’s personal transport vehicle I may be able to tell you tales about all the different and interesting people it picks up, all the interesting and different places it goes but alas, I’m here to tell Dustin’s story. He’s still in his chair. I wonder if he will eat today.\n</p>\n<p>I’ll cut you to the end of the day. Dustin got out of his chair three more times. One time to let the SuperVac-MegaClean 2.0 out of his apartment, that event went something like this:\n</p>\n<p>Dustin, standing by his front door, disengages the lock and opens the door. As the SuperVac-MegaClean 2.0 makes its way out the door it exclaims “Thank. You. Sir. Or. Madam. For. Allowing. Me. To. Serve.” possibly even more metalically than when it arrived due to the acoustics of the tiled hallway. As the robot is disappearing from his view Dustin stammers “G-goodbye” in a manner which would be rather endearing if he didn’t sound so sick.\n</p>\n<p>The second time Dustin rose from his chair was to make instant cup noodles, the same brand as he had bought from the vending machine the day before, “Mama’s Good Noodle”. This particular flavour was “ramen meal number four”. The final time Dustin rose from his chair was to use the toilet, as you have seen with me thus far, Dustin’s diet is not particularly well balanced so I will definitely spare you the details of that event.\n</p>\n<p>Dustin is now lying in bed, his covers wrapped tightly around his frail frame. His bamboo pillow is playing gentle ambient music at an almost inaudible volume. Dustin keeps opening and closing his eyes, and sighing. He rolls from side to side. He stares at the ceiling. He stretches and moans. He folds himself into various positions, some of which are so bizarre it almost looks as though he is practising yoga. Dustin’s struggle to sleep is clear and pitiful. Eventually Dustin’s writhing and sighing relents, his body remains still and the faint sound of a snore emerges. Good night Dustin.\n</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>9.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function DsTen() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Dustin's Story</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 3 Addendum.</h2>\n            <p>The SuperVac-MegaClean 2.0 is one of the many household robots designed and built by one of ThinkCom’s many robotics subsidiaries; Useful Robot (Get a Chinese name). This marvellous cleaning robot is capable of autonomously eradicating 99% of household dirt. Vacuuming was the initial selling point for home cleaning robots introduced into our homes in the early 21st century and certainly that is where the SuperVac-MegaClean 2.0 excels. But of course after years of development its functionality is not that limited. Windows, tiles, ovens, leathers, carpets, the SuperVac-MegaClean 2.0 can effectively deep clean your entire living space in less than 4 hours or your money back. Honestly it really is a fantastic machine. The price however came as quite a shock to consumers who had become quite used to buying robots to work in their homes. Except for the exceptionally wealthy, consumers were priced out of purchasing robots to work in their own homes, forced into paying for the robot by the hour if they wanted their homes cleaned by machines. This service was still cheaper than paying a human to clean your house and obviously was still much more convenient than doing it yourself and so was still extremely successful.\n</p>\n<p>Other service robots include the state owned personal transport vehicles, ThinkCom’s paralegals, lawyer robots designed to replace public defenders, the aforementioned robot chefs and, of course, for dine-in restaurants, robot table staff. Almost every service position that can be has been filled by a robot. The sheer efficiency and consistent quality of work provided by these wonderful creations far outshines any human’s ability. There are still human operated shops, restaurants and hotels but this is always sold as a gimmick and extremely expensive in comparison to robot run operations. These human run establishments are usually visited by wealthy families who want to experience what life was like before robots did everything perfectly. Such families can usually be found exclaiming “Oh how exhilarating, the chef has cooked my steak slightly too much!” or “Look, there’s dust on this windowsill!” Most people, however, do not get to experience such delights and have to make do with perfectly cooked food and almost laboratory clean rooms at normal robot run businesses.\n</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>10.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport DsOne from './ds/one';\nimport DsTwo from './ds/two';\nimport DsThree from './ds/three';\nimport DsFour from './ds/four';\nimport DsFive from './ds/five';\nimport DsSix from './ds/six';\nimport DsSeven from './ds/seven';\nimport DsEight from './ds/eight';\nimport DsNine from './ds/nine';\nimport DsTen from './ds/ten';\n\nclass DsComp extends Component {   \n\n\n    state = {\n        index: 0, \n        pageList: [<DsOne/>, <DsTwo/>, <DsThree/>, <DsFour/>, <DsFive/>, <DsSix/>, <DsSeven/>, <DsEight/>, <DsNine/>, <DsTen/>]\n      }\n      \n      onClickNext= () => {\n          if (this.state.index + 1 === this.state.pageList.length ){\n              this.setState({ \n                  index: 0 \n                })\n            } else {\n                this.setState({\n                    index: this.state.index + 1\n                })\n            }\n\n          }\n          onClickPrevious= () => {\n            if (this.state.index - 1 === -1 ){\n                this.setState({ \n                    index: this.state.pageList.length - 1\n                  })\n              } else {\n                  this.setState({\n                      index: this.state.index - 1\n                  })\n              }\n            }\n      \n      render() {\n        return (\n          <div>\n            {this.state.pageList[this.state.index]} \n            <div className=\"footerButtons\">\n            <button style={{\"fontSize\":\"18px\"}} onClick={this.onClickPrevious}> Previous </button>\n            <button className=\"nextButton\" style={{\"margin-left\":\"5px\", \"fontSize\":\"18px\"}} onClick={this.onClickNext}> Next </button>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n\n}\n\n\nexport default DsComp;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport WritingNav from '../writingNav';\nimport DsComp from './ds-comp';\n\n\n\nexport default function dustinStory() {\n    return (\n        <div>\n        <WritingNav/>\n        <DsComp/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StdmOne() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Said the dead man - Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <h2>The Death Monks</h2>\n            <p>The monks always chose their retreats to places as close to death as possible. This often meant they spent large amounts of time in the countryside, where people who have lived long, sometimes hard, lives, go to wait for death. Currently the pair found themselves living atop the Great Orme in North Wales. Everyday as they sat, meditated and performed their daily rituals, they were overlooking a great many people who were pottering around doing little more than awaiting their own demise. This made the monks feel at peace. Sometimes they would speak to the locals and hear wonderful tales of how such-and-such’s grandchild just got a job at a bank or how their friend had just been to such an exotic location as Greece. At his age! Could they believe it? This made the monks feel very close to death indeed, which made the monks very happy. </p>\n            <p>Sometimes the locals would ask the monks if they had spoken to their recently deceased, or if they could somehow help them have a chat with a dead loved one. The monks, of course, being men of honour, even when large sums of money were mentioned, always told the requester the truth: They can only commune with the dead at the place of their death, and not for an indefinite period of time. </p>\n            <p>Their stay on the Great Orme was coming to an end, they could sense that. They would miss this place, truly it was beautiful. The younger monk had sat in fascination for hours watching the Kashmiri goats effortlessly scale the sheer cliff faces. He had even befriended one of them, or rather one of the goats had made a friend of him. It had become enamoured with the delightful flavour of the monk’s robe one night as he slept. When he awoke to find the animal chewing lazily on his finest (only) garment he had been initially rather upset with the goat. He had said some rather unpleasant things to the goat. He had thrown some rather weighty objects at the goat in an attempt to get the brazenly stupid animal to understand that what it was doing was wrong. All to no avail. The goat simply could not care what the monk wanted, it continued to chew lazily on the delicious robe. Being astonished by the unabashed thick brained stubborness of the animal the monk began to calm down. How foolish he had been, he thought, for allowing his emotions to control him so. Over something as simple as a robe, against something as simple as this goat. His master would not be pleased. He approached the goat and laid a hand on its head. It continued to chew. </p>\n            <p>“You’re alright, goat” he had said.</p>\n            <p>“Baa-aaa” the goat had replied.</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>1.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StdmTwo() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Said the dead man - Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <h2>The Death Monks</h2>\n            <p>The older monk had enjoyed his time on the Great Orme as well. Though he had far less interest in the local fauna he had always enjoyed any time spent in Wales. The pleasant peaks and valleys reminded him of the mountains of his home, Taiwan. He also rather enjoyed rain, which though of course blessed him across the whole of the United Kingdom, blessed him with particular regularity in Wales. He enjoyed the sea view as he sat. He enjoyed the quiet stillness as he meditated. He enjoyed listening to the locals switch from having a conversation in English to having a conversation in Welsh as they got closer to him. But the winds were changing, autumn was approaching and so was a police car, its flashing lights and blaring sirens feeling a bit out of place in the idyllic Welsh countryside.</p>\n            <p>The police car made its way up the Great Orme towards the summit, all the way up blaring sirens and announcing through the loudspeaker. Of course with the distortion of the loudspeaker and the volume of the sirens whatever point the police car was trying to get across was totally intelligible to anyone close enough to hear it. Only static and syllables could be heard. Maybe if enough people who had heard the message at different points along the car’s path got together and collected all the syllables they had heard, like a kind of audio jigsaw they could, in time, piece together just what it was that the police car was trying to tell them so urgently. Fortunately upon reaching the summit and parking in front of a nice little cafe the siren abated, so this farcical rigmarole would not be necessary. Now only the muffled, distorted voice of a young PC could be heard.</p>\n            <p>“We’re looking for a couple of monks, has anybody seen them?

The chip shop, ‘Do You Believe In Cod’, is closed. Police ticker tape creates an ineffective barricade on the open door, however the rather larger PC standing in the doorway does the job quite well. The owner of ‘Do You Believe In Cod’, one Dwayne Jones, is rather upset about the situation. </p>\n            <p>“It’s a Saturday, we get our best trade on a Saturday. It’s not like anyone was murdered actually in the shop!” he protests.</p>\n            <p>“I understand that the death of the occupant of the flat above your shop is something of an inconvenience for you. But, I would ask you to consider how much more of an inconvenience it is for the deceased.” The PC responds.</p>\n            <p>“But why do we need to shut my shop? He died in his flat. My shop is quite innocent, I assure you!” </p>\n            <p>“Well, sir, the only way to access the flat is to go through this door, which unfortunately for you is also the only way to access your shop. If we let you open for business who knows how many people will be in and out, clogging up the entryway, trying to get a look at the crime scene or, indeed, trying to hide evidence.”</p>\n            <p>Rather flustered by the PC’s calmness in the face of his dismay, Dwayne Jones takes to flailing his arms around in frustration. After a good minute of flailing it is as if lightning has struck. His eyes light up, his mouth curls into a smile. He’s just had an idea.</p>\n            <p>“How about I cook up a batch for you and the other officers?” He asks slyly, “I’ll give you an excellent discount.”</p>\n            <p>The PC likes the sound of this. He likes the sound of this very much. Fish and chips would really hit the spot. It would definitely make him feel better about standing in the cold, windy, drizzly doorway all afternoon. “Do you do mushy peas?” The PC asks, raising his eyebrows. </p>\n            <p>Mr Jones steps forward and raises the ticker tape, he gives the PC a slow nod and a smile before walking into his shop. “I’ll get the fryer on.”</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>3.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StdmFour() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Said the dead man - Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <h2>The Detectives</h2>\n            <p>The smell of greasy chips permeates through the ceiling of the chip shop and gives the flat above the almost, but not quite, repulsive aroma of stale batter. In the flat, oblivious to the fact that they will soon be dining on fish and chips, detectives Alex Cummings and Joan Forester survey the crime scene. </p>\n            <p>“Fuck. Me.” Alex exclaims. </p>\n            <p>“What the actual fuck is this?” Joan echoes Alex’s horror. </p>\n            <p> It’s a small, one room flat. A kitchen sits against the back wall. A sofa, which appears to double as a bed is positioned in the centre of the room, facing a TV which leans against the wall under the window which faces out onto the street. Though at the moment the detectives are not quite able to focus on the view. Nor are they able to focus on the rather nice house plant which sits on the windowsill. Their inability to focus on these things is quite forgivable, as the plant, rather than having been planted in a plant pot, has been planted in the top of a severed human head. Blood has spilled all over the windowsill and onto the floor from where the head’s neck used to connect to its body. Speaking of the body. Sitting on the sofa, wearing a full set of gardening attire, holding in its hands a pair of bloodied gardening shears, is a body with no head. Given the situation, it can be forgiven, even for detectives, to have missed the woman standing in the corner of the kitchen.</p>\n            <p>“Well we’re not touching anything until forensics get here.” Alex looks, wide-eyed, at Joan, trying to stay calm and process the scene before him.</p>\n            <p>Joan nods at Alex “Right, forensics... they should be on their way... What a mess this is...” Joan creeps slowly forward into the flat. Alex is not so brave. </p>\n            <p>The woman standing in the kitchen is beginning to realise that she has not been noticed. Not wanting to startle the detectives, who have just borne witness to a rather gruesome scene, she tries to draw attention to herself by gently clearing her throat. The detectives seem transfixed by the scene before them. She tries again, a little louder. Still nothing. Still struggling to think of the most socially acceptable way to draw attention to herself in such a situation, the woman decides she has waited long enough.</p>\n            \n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>4.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StdmFive() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Said the dead man - Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <h2>The Detectives</h2>\n            <p>“Cup of tea?” she asks.</p>\n            <p>“Oh, go on then” both detectives absently reply, before realising that the question must have come from somewhere. They both turn sharply to face the woman.</p>\n            <p>“Who are you?” Alex asks accusingly.</p>\n            <p>“I’m Wynny, this is my brother’s flat.”</p>\n            <p>“Oh.

I was just coming to check on him, he wasn’t answering his phone and his boss hadn’t seen or heard from him for two days so I let myself in with the spare key.” Wynny points to a key on the kitchen counter. </p>\n            <p>Wynny puts the kettle on and fetches some mugs for the detective’s tea.</p>\n            <p>“What should I call you, detectives...?” Wynny asks.</p>\n            <p>“Joan Forester and Alex Cummings” Joan replies, showing her badge whilst gesturing for Alex to do the same. “You are?”</p>\n            <p>“As I said I’m Bran’s sister, Wynny Hughes.”</p>\n            <p>Alex takes out his notepad and begins to write.</p>\n            <p>“Oh, it’s Wynny with a ‘Y’. And I’m not married, so my brother is also a Hughes. Bran Hughes.”</p>\n            <p>“Thank you Miss Hughes” Alex replies curtly as he crosses out ‘Winnie’ and rewrites ‘Winny’. “So you called us a little over an hour ago, correct?”</p>\n            <p>“That sounds about right, yes, detective. Honestly I’m not too sure how long it’s been.” The detectives are just now focusing on Wynny fully. Her eyes are red and puffy. Tears have caused her makeup to run. She’s paler than anything. She looks as though she’s exhausting herself just trying to keep herself together. </p>\n            <p>Joan gives Alex a sympathetic look. She steps towards Wynny and places her hands on her shoulders.</p>\n            <p>“We don’t need to do this now. You need to go home and rest. Don’t worry about talking to anyone else today. Today you rest, you need it. When you feel ready, give me a call.” Joan hands a card to Wynny “This is my private number, it’ll go straight to me. Whenever you’re ready we’ll need to ask you some questions about your brother. But now, go. Rest.”</p>\n            <p>Tears begin to fall from Wynny’s eyes. She had been holding it all together so well just moments ago. She falls forward and hugs Joan tight. Burying her head in the detective’s shoulder, weeping softly. Alex has never been one for displays of genuine human emotions. They always made him feel extremely uncomfortable. Unfortunately for Alex in the rest of the flat there was not much to look to for comfort. As Joan offers Wynny a few more sympathetic words, Wynny cries, sniffles and tries to regain enough composure to leave the flat. Alex takes to pretending to write in his notepad in order to escape from the display. After what feels like a lifetime of pretend writing, Wynny sniffles her last and walks away. Joan shuts the door as she goes and turns to give Alex ‘the face’. Alex knows ‘the face’ very well. It is the face his partner gives him every single time he’s inadequate in the line of duty. This is a particularly fierce rendition of ‘the face’. By now, after being Joan’s partner for four years, Alex has learnt there is no point saying anything, as anything he does say will be used against him. </p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>5.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StdmSix() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Said the dead man - Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <h2>The Fixer</h2>\n            <p>Francesca Tierney had always expected her job would take her to many exciting and interesting places.

Ms. Tierney went above and beyond. The couple ate dinner with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, were driven in a limo by a member of the Queen’s guard who also acted as a tour guide, explaining the rich histories of all of London’s most famous sites, which on those days just so happened to be closed to the general public for maintenance. </p>\n            <p>Such a feat did not come overnight. Francesca, always with the help of her assistant Claire McLeod, has been working this most bizarre job, building bridges, forming contacts and getting to know the right people, for almost 30 years. </p>\n            <p>Francesca’s current job has taken her to the Isle of Man. An American landscape painter, who believes he is of Manx descent, wants to ‘paint the old country’ as he puts it. Francesca decided to take the job, despite its simplicity, not only as she saw it as an in to the rather lucrative world of art, but also because the painter immediately accepted her initial invoice. Her initial invoice, of course, is always something of a bartering trick. Featuring many obscene expenses, always grossly overpriced, it’s more of a feeler to see just how rich her clients are. There have not been many occasions where a client has simply accepted her first quote, but it seems Quincy McMadden is an exceedingly successful painter. The most difficult and truly expensive part of McMadden’s request was the procurement of several varieties of bespoke paints to be ready for him upon his arrival. Oils, acrylics, watercolours and even pastels, all specially designed by several different craftsmen for Mr McMadden. Then there was the canvases, an unthinkable number, various shapes and sizes, but at least it explained all the paint. After that, Francesca had erected a hide in the hills near Milner’s Tower, providing 360degree views of a truly beautiful part of the world. McMadden has insisted he wanted to paint in all weathers to capture the true beauty of the old country. The hide is rather luxurious, featuring a bathroom, a kitchenette, an actual bed, storage for the incredible volume of canvas, and a drying area which has some sort of intricate airflow designed to help paintings dry quicker. All whilst remaining quite hidden in the local landscape, as to not be disturbed by tourists or locals  alike. </p>\n            <p>Having sorted everything out prior to the arrival of her client Francesca now finds herself in a rather unusual situation. Usually she would be working to the whims of her clients, having to fight to book the entire London Eye with 12hours notice and fill all but one of the compartments to the brim with rose petals, or arranging flights for family chefs to join their clients on the trip because they don’t like British food. Quincy McMadden, however, intends to remain in his hide painting for two months. What this means for Francesca, or at least what it has meant so far, is that for two months she is essentially an incredibly expensive food delivery service. At least once a day McMadden calls Francesca and asks for some local food. He doesn’t even make it difficult for her, just anything local and rustic will do. As a result, Francesca and her assistant have a lot of free time on their hands. For a naturally busy person, as Francesca loves to be, despite its simplicity, this has actually turned into one of her hardest jobs.</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>6.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StdmSeven() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Said the dead man - Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <h2>The Fixer</h2>\n            <p>“I am incredibly bored, Claire” Francesca exclaims, more at Claire than to her. Though this side of Francesca is a recent discovery for her long suffering assistant, it did not take long for Claire to get used to her employer’s new attitude. Claire was selected to be Francesca’s assistant for her exceptional timekeeping, appointment making, sociable skills and ability to give her a swift metaphorical kick up the arse whenever Francesca had her moments of doubt. For Claire, this latest job is the closest thing she has to a holiday in about three years. Francesca’s services have been in hot demand and one job has constantly led into the next. Here she is now, sitting in a cafe on the seafront at Port Erin. Enjoying a cup of tea with only the worry of what to buy for dinner. </p>\n            <p>Claire lets out an exasperated sigh “I know you’re bored, but... look at this” Claire gestures to the sea before them and the hills behind them, it is a rather lovely day. “Try to think of it as a holiday. Failing that you’ve got all the time in the world to pitch to new clients.” </p>\n            <p>“We’re never doing an artist again. Make a note of that. Well... unless maybe it’s some sort of modern artist. You know, like if someone like Damien Hurst wants us to get them a great white shark to dissect, that might prove quite interesting. But never a traditional artist.” Claire is not listening at all. Francesca’s phone begins ringing. “Oh thank Christ! Hello? Hello? Go to the corner the signal is bad... Hello, yes, Mr McMadden... And, yes, a top of the morning to you to...” Claire takes out her notepad, ever dutiful, and prepares to write. “What’s that?... A chair... Where?... On the hill?... Well yes I can see how such a colourful chair might ruin the authenticity of a traditional landscape painting... No, of course that’s something I can do, that’s what you pay me for... Yes, yes Mr McMadden I’ll see to it right away.” Francesca hangs up and leaps from her seat. “Finish your tea Claire, we’re going to move a chair! Oh god Claire, I’m excited about moving a chair.”</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>7.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StdmEight() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Said the dead man - Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <h2>Death Monks and Detectives</h2>\n            <p>The forensics officers make their final rounds to ensure that nothing has been missed. Alex and Joan lean against the kitchen counters, both drinking a cup of tea. They know it will be a long day. Once the forensics officers are sure they’ve bagged and tagged what needs to be bagged and tagged, dusted for prints what needs to be dusted for prints, and swabbed what needs to be swabbed, they give a solemn wave to the detectives as they make their exit.</p>\n            <p>“It’s ready for them now, when they leave we’ll come back in and bag the body” one of the forensics officers says, as he walks out the door.</p>\n            <p>At that moment the doors of a police car parked outside swing open. The two monks emerge from the car. The older monk, Mr Tang, has been briefing his apprentice, Mr Ho, about what to expect. This will be his first murder. First of many, most likely. The monks enter the building.</p>\n            <p>“Can you feel it?” Mr Tang asks. “This is the presence of the dead, a very distinct feeling, one you will come to know very well.”</p>\n            <p>“I have felt the dead before, master. Though this does feel a bit different.” Mr Ho says nervously.</p>\n            <p>The monks begin climbing the stairs to the flat, squeezing past the forensics officers, who are perhaps the only people dressed more strangely than themselves. They both utter a silent prayer and run their fingers in a circle around the ring which adorns the front of their robes. They knock on the door. Joan opens it and ushers for them to come inside. They bow, nod, and master gestures for his apprentice to enter first. Once both monks are inside the flat, far more than the presence of death, they feel the anxious eyes of detectives Cummings and Forester.</p>\n            <p>“I take it you’ve not seen us work before, detective?” Mr Tang smiles calmly and bows slightly, directing his question at the more senior looking of the two detectives.</p>\n            <p>Alex looks at Joan, who is actually the more senior detective, hoping she’ll answer for him. She doesn’t, her eyes do seem to be screaming at Alex though, telling him to get on with it and answer. “We haven’t. I’ve heard about it, but we’ve never had a murder before. What will happen?”</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>8.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StdmNine() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Said the dead man - Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <h2>Death Monks and Detectives</h2>\n            <p>“There’s nothing to worry about. For you, nothing will happen, nothing at all. We just need you to keep your energy in check, as to not disturb our communion. My apprentice will try making first contact today, Mr Ho is quite capable, even though he may not appear so” Mr Tang subtly gestures to the chewed area of his apprentice’s robe. “You will be perfectly fine to stay in the kitchen, we will relay any messages to you when we are able. Now before we begin, have you prepared any questions for the deceased?”</p>\n            <p>Alex freezes like a rabbit in headlights. They hadn’t thought of any questions to ask the deceased, why would they, he’s dead. Alex starts to stutter, letting out a few ‘ums’ and ‘ahs’. Alex starts to go a bit red. Joan comes to his rescue.</p>\n            <p>“Well, we only really had one question: ‘Do you know who killed you?’”</p>\n            <p>“OK, yes, that does seem to be a popular one. OK, detectives, we will of course also be asking our own questions, feel free to record us or take notes as you need, just remember that whatever we’re asking, no matter how redundant it might seem, we are on your side. Sometimes detectives try to intervene because they think we’re asking questions which don’t pertain to the case. These interventions almost always cause a total loss of contact with the spirit, generally for good. If you are ready, we will commence.”</p>\n            <p>The detectives give each other an anxious look before gesturing for the monks to proceed. Alex gets out his trusty notebook and Joan perches on the counter, watching intently. The two monks walk over to the window. Both seem entirely unfazed by the severed head on the windowsill and its headless body on the sofa. Mr Tang bows for his apprentice. Mr Ho repeats a short mantra in a language unknown to the detectives. Suddenly he stops.</p>\n            <p>“Hello” Mr Ho says, “I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news.”</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>9.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StdmTen() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Said the dead man - Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <h2>Death Monks and Detectives</h2>\n            <p>The decapitated head of Bran Hughes comes alive before the monks. Its eyes darting left and right. Its jaw gnashing. Its nostrils flaring. After a few seconds it stops. The head locks eyes with Mr Ho.</p>\n            <p>“Not more bad news...” Bran grumbles.</p>\n            <p>“Yes, I’m afraid you’ve died.”</p>\n            <p>“Oh.”</p>\n            <p>Mr Tang joins the conversation “Yes, we know it can be very disorienting, but there’s nothing to be afraid of now. We’re here to help you.”</p>\n            <p>“Is that right?” Bran asks incredulously. “How exactly do you intend to help me?”</p>\n            <p>“Well” Mr Tang continues, “We are here to make sure your passing is as comfortable as possible. We’re here to talk and help you understand what’s happening to you.”</p>\n            <p>“So what happens now then?”</p>\n            <p>“Well, it’s a bit different for everyone” Mr Ho explains “What we know for sure is that your spirit will linger here for a while. For some, it’s a matter of minutes, for others it can take weeks. We don’t really know why. Some believe it to be to do with the fulfillingness of the deceased’s life. Others believe it to be down to cause of death.”</p>\n            <p>“There are even some who think it’s just random.” Mr Tang interjects.</p>\n            <p>“Yes, there are. When we speak to spirits, we like to ask a few questions to try and get a bit of data to help us determine the reason-”</p>\n            <p>“If there is a reason” Mr Tang interjects again.</p>\n            <p>“-y-yes, if there is a reason for the difference in time each spirit spends lingering. Can we ask you a few questions?”</p>\n            <p>Bran’s eyes look around his flat. He tries to click his jaw a few times. “Oh go on then, I suppose I don’t have much else to do. Ask me your questions.”</p>\n            <p>The monks bow in thanks. The detectives looking on from the kitchen are a little baffled. To them, the head remains lifeless and dumb. What they can hear and see is two men having an unrequited conversation with a severed head.</p>\n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>10.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StdmEleven() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Said the dead man - Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <h2>Death Monks and Detectives</h2>\n            <p>“We’ll start with some simple questions.

Quite miserable it was.”</p>\n            <p>“Oh really? Why was that?”</p>\n            <p>“Beats me. Was just made that way. Hey, maybe you know, did some sort of god make me the way I am?”</p>\n            <p>“Oh, well we don’t really know that. A lot of people do go in for that kind of thing, but we death monks simply believe in the one inescapable truth of death, and we certainly don’t believe death ever made anything.” The old monk chuckles to himself.</p>\n            <p>“So where will I go next? Heaven? Hell?” Bran asks impatiently.</p>\n            <p>Mr Ho has regained his colour and his composure “Well, you’ll leave here, we know that much and that is all we know.

They look at each other in disbelief. After what feels like a lifetime Mr Ho breaks their silence. “Uh, I’m sorry, can you say that again?”</p>\n            <p>“It’s all rather awkward you know?

They look to the ceiling, to the headless body on the sofa, to the head which now serves as a plant pot. They look at the detectives, and to each other, muttering several ‘if’s and ‘but’s. Bran grows tired of the monk’s astonishment, he has a question for the monks.</p>\n            <p>“I was meaning to ask,” he says, “how are you going to talk to him?

And I don’t have any gardening gear. You’re in my flat. Do you see a garden?”</p>\n            <p>The monks look at each other once more. Mr Tang asks for clarification. “Are you quite sure that’s not your body?”</p>\n            <p>“I think I’d know my own body. That is not me. So how will you speak to him?”</p>\n            <p>“Well actually we just need to be in the place the person died... but you’re the only spirit here, which means he must have been killed somewhere else and brought here...” Mr Ho explains, slowly understanding what the recent development means.</p>\n            <p>Mr Tang adds “Do you know anybody who might have wanted to hurt you? Or anybody who would... do this to your body? Do you know whose body is on your sofa?”</p>\n            <p>“I don’t really know anybody. I know my boss doesn’t like me, but I don’t think he’d cut my head off and plant a flower in it. He hates gardening. Haven’t a clue who that body could be.”</p>\n            <p>Mr Ho briefly glances at the detectives who are looking on with incredibly puzzled faces. Mr Tang takes charge.</p>\n            <p>“OK, Bran, we need to have a word with the detectives over there to let them know what you’ve told us. Is there anything you’d like us to pass on to anyone, a message for family or anything like that?”</p>\n            <p>“Can you put me in front of the TV and leave it on?” </p>\n            <p>Mr Tang sighs at the deflection. “We’re not allowed to do that, Bran. The forensics officers will be in soon to collect your head and... that body. Me and Mr Ho here will be back tomorrow to check on your spirit, to see if you’ve passed on. Goodbye for now, Bran.”</p>\n            <p>The monks walk away from Bran, as they do the head ceases to move and returns to its original position. They explain what they have learned to the bewildered detectives.</p>\n            <p>“We thought you guys were supposed to make murders easy to solve. You’ve turned a simple, if gruesome, murder into the murder of a John Doe with a headless body and an unknown murder site, and the desecration of a corpse from a suicide with an almost entirely missing body.” Joan is absolutely astonished.</p>\n           <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>12.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StdmThirteen() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Said the dead man - Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <h2>The Fixer and The Painter</h2>\n            <p>Having got as close as they can by car, Francesca and Claire begin their walk up the hill towards Milner’s Tower. Francesca had seen the rogue chair from the car. A blue and red folding chair, most likely from someone’s trip to the beach down in Port Erin. Perhaps it had been fly tipped by a tourist who couldn’t fit it in their suitcase, and then it has been blown up here, Francesca thought. As they walk up the hill, at a brisker pace than Claire would like, she attempts to get Francesca to appreciate the scenery, the beauty of the sea and the hills around them. Francesca barely hears her assistant, completely tunnelled on getting to that chair as fast as she can.</p>\n            <p>Nearing the chair now, Francesca slows down. She stops. Claire stops beside her. “There’s a woman in the chair, Claire.” She says.</p>\n            <p>Claire peers towards the chair and it seems, indeed, that there is a golden haired woman slumped in the chair. “Ah, you want me to work my magic, do you?”</p>\n            <p>“Well, Claire, you know you’re much better with the general public than I am, people tell me I tend to come off as combative and cold, but also hot tempered, so how does that work...” Francesca begins to ponder her contradictory character assessment.</p>\n            <p>Claire strides confidently towards the chair, shouting to its occupant “Hello my dear, could I have a minute of your time?” The strategy does not seem to be working. The blonde woman doesn’t even flinch. “Are you okay?” Claire asks, with genuine concern. As she grows closer more and more things seem wrong. The woman is sitting far too low in the chair. Her head is tilted at what looks like a very uncomfortable angle. Closer now. The hair on her arms seems dark, it’s not unusual to dye your hair of course, but her blonde hair looks perfectly natural. The way her arms rest on the chair’s arms is a bit odd too, like they’re too heavy for her. Closer. What’s that red stuff? She’s bleeding.</p>\n            <p>“Fran!” Claire shouts “This lass is in trouble.” Claire runs towards the chair. Francesca runs after her. Claire puts a hand on the woman’s shoulder. Her head rolls onto the floor. Claire immediately turns away and begins to vomit as the smell hits her. Francesca stops mid-stride and almost falls over.</p>\n            <p>Watching the scene from his hide, not too far away, Quincy MacMadden bolts for the door. Running top speed towards his two associates he begins shouting “What the fuck was that, girls?”</p>\n            <p>He reaches the chair. Francesca is sitting with Claire, one arm around her, the other clutching her phone to her ear.</p>\n            <p>“Mr MacMadden, I’m talking to the police. Well I’ve spoken to them, someone is on the way. I’m sorry, but moving the chair will have to wait. I think this just became a crime scene.” Francesca does not crack under pressure, she is still a consummate professional. It’s still clear, though, that the event has rattled her. Her eyes are wide and they dart around with no particular direction. She is shaking slightly, and the fervour with which she grips her phone to her ear is not dissimilar to a child holding tight their favourite cuddly toy during a scary movie they’re not supposed to be watching. “They’ve asked me to stay on the line until someone arrives.” She adds.</p>            \n            <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>13.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StdmFourteen() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Said the dead man - Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <h2>The Fixer and The Painter</h2>\n            <p>“Francesca, Claire, are you guys okay?” Quincy’s worry clearly goes beyond the chair ruining his painting. He looks at the blue chair, half red with blood. He looks at the woman’s head, face down in the dirt. He looks at the body, still slumped in the chair. “Oh my god” he exclaims without giving Francesca or Claire a chance to respond, “That’s a man...” Quincy points at the body.</p>\n            <p>Francesca looks at the chair for the first time since seeing the head hit the ground. From where she’s sitting she can only really see an arm resting on the arm of the chair, and a pair of legs through the chair’s legs. Even with this limited information Francesca reaches the same conclusion. “Its hands are hairy, and those are definitely a man’s shoes, so it must be a man with long hair, nothing particularly strange about that, we just assumed incorrectly...” Francesca reasons reasonably.</p>\n            <p>“This feels like a very inappropriate thing to say at a time like this, but I promise I mean it just as an artist. I know what the back of a woman’s head looks like.” Quincy approaches the head.</p>\n            <p>“Hey, I really think you should leave him... or her alone.” Francesca tries to dissuade the American, but his curiosity gets the better of him.

Ever since the curse of the scythe, support for the province from the capital, Stormwind, has been minimal. The eternal darkness, which gives the province its name, has been slowly killing almost all which lives in Duskwood for years. Despite this there are still those in Duskwood who refuse to give up their homes and farms. They grow what they can and supplement what little they harvest with the small rations they receive from Stormwind. Malnutrition and sickness are a way of life in Duskwood but its people are stubborn. They would rather struggle to get by in their own homes, on their own land, than move away and start again from nothing. </p>\n            <p>Where there is strife there is exploitation. For years the Defias Brotherhood, an organised group of bandits, had a stranglehold on the Duskwood. They would hold up supply carts, forcing the locals to either massively over-pay for goods or to starve. The Defias Brotherhood have since relaxed their grip on Duskwood, partially due to the deaths of some of their more prominent conspirators but mostly due to having bled the province for all its worth.</p>\n            <p>A myriad of other problems still beset the people of Duskwood almost daily. Every so often, travellers, on their way through Duskwood, (as no one in their right mind would be travelling to Duskwood), take pity as they observe the local towns and communities and offer any aid they can.</p>\n            \n           <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>1.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function WwTwo() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Warcraft Class Fantasy: Warrior/Warlock</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <p>An old warrior, a veteran now of more wars than he would like, ties his horse, in front of Darkshire’s Inn, the Scarlet Raven Tavern. The horse looks to have served almost as long as the warrior himself. Though old, it looks as sturdy as a siege engine. The warrior’s matted grey hair says as much about his age as his leathered skin and his wrinkled face. As he finishes tying his horse and strides inside, however, his movements still show the confidence and strength of youth. An imposing figure, at well over 6ft tall, the warrior draws the attention of the entire Inn as he steps inside. He attempts a gentle smile and offers a small wave to one group, perched around a table who seem particularly uneasy about his presence. After a moment’s silence the patrons of the inn resume their conversations and the warrior approaches the bar.</p>\n            <p>“Good day to you sir” remarks a rather emaciated looking barkeeper. “Hann’s the name, welcome to the Scarlet Raven. If you’re looking for lodgings we’ve got rooms that are warm enough for a night or two. If you need something to eat our chef, Grual, can knock you something up. It won't be gourmet but he does his best with what we have. And, of course, if you’re just here to wet your whistle we’ve got some ales, though for any of the finer stuff I’m afraid we have a one stein per customer limit.”</p>\n            <p>“I’ll take one stein of... you got anything Dwarven?” The warrior replies gruffly.</p>\n            <p>“Sure thing, I think we’ve got some Thundermar left in the keg.” Hann almost fills a decorative stein from an aged looking keg which wheezes and gasps for air as it drips the last few drops into the stein. “Seems like we’re gonna have to get a new keg...” Hann grimaces, knowing this will not be an easy task, “I’m sorry it’s not quite full”</p>\n            <p>“It’s plenty, thank you” says the warrior, attempting to be comforting but coming across as far more intimidating than he would like. “I know the troubles that beset these lands.”</p>\n            <p>“W-what err, brings you to Darkshire, sir? Don’t suppose you’re here to help with those troubles?” Hann stutters.</p>\n            <p>“I’m not sure what good I could do for you. My skills lie only in combat, the evil which befalls this place is not something which I can fight. I’m merely passing through, on my way to the Vale. There’s a man I must talk to. Due to... certain recent actions he is no longer welcome in Alliance towns or cities but he asked me to meet him in Booty Bay. I consider this man a close friend and know... well... rather hope, he would not betray the Alliance without reason. I need to hear his side of the story.”</p>\n            <p>The barkeeper nods contemplatively “I see sir, sounds like you keep interesting company. Well I know most are just trying to get out of this place in a hurry but your skills might be more useful than you think. If you’ve time and the inclination, please have a talk to the fine lass sitting in that group over there. That’s Althea Ebonlocke, she’s the daughter of the mayor and the commander of the Night Watch. If anyone knows how a man with your particular skills could help this town it’d be her.”</p>\n            <p>The warrior looks to the woman Hann is gesturing towards. A young dark haired woman sits with several large bedraggled men around a long table. Each man sits sullen faced and silent, clutching their steins as a child their mother’s hand. The dark haired woman, evidently Althea Ebonlocke, bears a scowl but has no need for the comforts of a stein. She is clearly in the midsts of some kind of rant. In the middle of the table are piled various arms ranging from strong, if unkempt, iron swords to well used stone mallets. Truly a militia’s armaments, were any of this equipment brought to a quartermaster in a professional army they would be immediately decommissioned. The whole group wear chainmail raiments, some more rusty than others but all bearing considerable signs of wear.</p>\n            <p>“The Night Watch? Mercenaries?” The warrior asks Hann.</p>\n            <p>“If you’re interested in their history I’d think there’d be no better person to explain it to you than Miss Ebonlocke. I know she looks rather stern but she’s always happy to speak the deeds of the Night Watch” Hann smiles slyly.</p>\n            <p>The warrior gives the barkeeper a nod of respect before reluctantly turning to approach the table.</p>\n\n            \n           <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>2.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function WwThree() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Warcraft Class Fantasy: Warrior/Warlock</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <p>As the warrior approaches the table Althea Ebonlocke’s ranting becomes clear. “...and Backus you said you’d driven them away, they’re still here. Just two days ago we lost another caravan to the damn Defias” The man sitting to her left’s head sinks further into his chest. Althea trails off and sighs exasperatedly before continuing. “Hutchins, Dodds, how goes the search for our old friend?” She asks calmly, though her face still wears a frown and the words old friend are filled with venom and spite.</p>\n            <p>A red haired man wearing an eyepatch hastily responds “We’ve an idea ma’am. We heard there have been sightings of a man who fits our friend’s description near the Yorgen Farmstead. Hutchins is taking watch thereabouts tonight and I the night after, we’re on his trail ma’am, he cannot avoid us forever.”</p>\n            <p>“Word of sightings...” Althea murmurs, visibly irritated. “And you will both watch alone? Suppose you find our target, do you believe you or Hutchins possess the strength to apprehend him alone? He overpowered three of our number in his escape from Darkshire, are you just arrogant or are you stupid, Dobbs?”</p>\n            <p>A long haired man stands up and slams his hands on the table “The three ‘men’ who were overpowered by this cursed sorcerer could be overpowered by my little finger. Me and Dobbs are the best fighters in the Watch and either one of us could easily, single handedly, bring our friend back to Darkshire any day of the fucking week!” Hutchins exclaims aggressively.</p>\n            <p>Althea rolls her eyes, not at all impressed by Hutchins’ display. “Arrogant and stupid. OK, if you’re such good fighters I won’t make you take a squad but you have to watch with a partner at least. Choose anyone you like, if they refuse to go or claim to have other duties let them know it’s a direct order from me.”</p>\n            <p>The warrior, deciding that this may be his best opportunity to make an introduction before the temperamental Miss Ebonlocke begins another tyrade, steps to the end of the Night Watch’s long table. “Good evening to you all, may I take a seat?” He asks politely, before taking a swig from his stein.</p>\n            <p>“You cannot. Certainly not without offering your name first.” Althea replies curtly.</p>\n            <p>“Then I shall stand” exclaims the warrior stoically as he places his stein on the Night Watch’s table. “The barkeeper tells me you’re in charge of the Night Watch, it’s not a name I know. Are you mercenaries? Guards? What is it you do?”</p>\n            \n\n            \n           <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>3.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function WwFour() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Warcraft Class Fantasy: Warrior/Warlock</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <p>“What interest is the history of the Night Watch to an old traveller?” Althea asks dismissively.</p>\n            <p>“Old soldier. And you look to be the type of lass that knows the strength required to live long enough to become an old soldier” rebukes the warrior.</p>\n            <p>“Strength... or cowardice...” Althea grins wickedly.</p>\n            <p>The warrior lets out a single laugh. He makes eye contact with Althea before reaching towards the pile of weapons on the table. One of the men moves to stop him but Althea orders him to stand down with a swift hand gesture. The warrior bats aside some of the smaller arms in order to wrap his hand around the torn leather hilt of a large, 4ft, solid iron hammer. The warrior plucks this wrought iron monster of a weapon from the table as easily as the men lift their steins. With one had he expertly twirls the hammer above the heads of the men sitting around the table. He then raises it effortlessly into the air above his head, the length of the, what would be to anyone else, unwieldy weapon combined with his own height causes the head of the hammer to brush the ceiling of the tavern. Then, in one swift movement, the warrior begins to bring the hammer down, stopping dead just inches away from the forehead of Althea Ebonlocke. She does not flinch. The men around the table are all but one in a stunned silence. The red haired man who spoke earlier, Dobbs, is the only one breaking the silence, engaging in a light nervous laughter. “Whose weapon is this?” The warrior asks “Its centre of balance makes it a cumbersome instrument, you may consider getting it shortened by a foot or so.”</p>\n            <p>One of the men timidly raises his hand. The warrior tosses the weapon to the man with a flick of his wrist. The man fails to catch it fully, the hilt collides with his chest and the weight of the hammer topples his chair backwards. He falls to the ground with a satisfying thud.</p>\n            <p>“Impressive” remarks Althea. “OK, old soldier, I will share our history with you if you are willing to hear a request from me. Does that suit you?”</p>\n            <p>“I can see no harm in hearing your request, I shall take a seat.” The warrior moves to the fallen chair and pushes the winded man, whose arms cradle the iron hammer, off it with his foot. He rights the chair and sits down, leaving the man lying on the floor, wheezing.</p>\n            <p>“Very well, I shall explain our history first, I think it’s important to give you a frame of reference before you hear my request” Althea speaks as though deep in thought and pauses for a while before continuing. “You asked if we are mercenaries, we are most certainly not, mercenaries are paid. You also asked if we are guards and maybe that would be a fitting description. However, don’t underestimate us, the Night Watch is more than a simple watchdog. We are a group dedicated to protecting the interests of Duskwood. We are Alliance in name only. Stormwind long since abandoned this province when our farms failed to provide adequate supplies for the guards stationed here. Now they send rations enough only for one quarter of our people. We believe King Wyrnn wants us to leave this cursed land and start anew elsewhere. But how can we do that? We have nothing. We cannot sell our holdings, our family homes, no one will buy them. We cannot raise the funds to leave by selling our goods because we need what little we can make and grow to survive day to day. Even if we weren’t trapped here, this is our home. Our birthright is here. If we were to leave we would end up as beggars on the streets of Stormwind.” Althea’s morose tone betrays her previously fearless persona. For the first time Althea appears vulnerable.</p>\n            <p>“So you are the last protectors of this land...” the warrior grimaces “I knew this place was beset by many sorrows but the King pulled all the guard? You protect this land alone against undead, feral worgen and Defias?”</p>\n            <p>“And more. It is not easy but we survive. We will continue to protect this land until such a time as the curse is broken, then we hope Stormwind will reconsider giving us their aid. If they do not then I suppose we will have to continue protecting this land until we die.” Althea’s stoic persona returns as she speaks of defending the land. “OK warrior, that is who we are. If you have no more questions, would you hear my request?”</p>\n            <p>“I gave my word. Please remember, though, I am a soldier. My skills lie in battle if you mean to ask me about the curse I’m afraid I know nothing of such things” the warrior responds wearily.</p>\n            <p>“Don’t worry, it’s not about the curse. I believe it is something you would be able to handle. It’s a long story though.” Althea turns to the man sitting to her left “Backus, fetch this soldier another stein, he’s going to need it.”</p>\n            \n\n            \n           <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>4.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport WwOne from './ww/one';\nimport WwTwo from './ww/two';\nimport WwThree from './ww/three';\nimport WwFour from './ww/four';\n\n\n\nclass WwComp extends Component {   \n\n\n    state = {\n        index: 0, \n        pageList: [<WwOne/>, <WwTwo/>, <WwThree/>, <WwFour/>]\n      }\n      \n      onClickNext= () => {\n          if (this.state.index + 1 === this.state.pageList.length ){\n              this.setState({ \n                  index: 0 \n                })\n            } else {\n                this.setState({\n                    index: this.state.index + 1\n                })\n            }\n\n          }\n          onClickPrevious= () => {\n            if (this.state.index - 1 === -1 ){\n                this.setState({ \n                    index: this.state.pageList.length - 1\n                  })\n              } else {\n                  this.setState({\n                      index: this.state.index - 1\n                  })\n              }\n            }\n      \n      render() {\n        return (\n          <div>\n            {this.state.pageList[this.state.index]} \n            <div className=\"footerButtons\">\n            <button style={{\"fontSize\":\"18px\"}} onClick={this.onClickPrevious}> Previous </button>\n            <button className=\"nextButton\" style={{\"margin-left\":\"5px\", \"fontSize\":\"18px\"}} onClick={this.onClickNext}> Next </button>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n\n}\n\n\nexport default WwComp;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport WritingNav from '../writingNav';\nimport WwComp from './ww-comp';\n\nexport default function wwStory() {\n    return (\n        <div>\n        <WritingNav/>\n        <WwComp/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function CisOne() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Culture in space</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <p>“Like, how does anyone even know if ‘earth gravity’ really is, like, earth’s gravity, man...

You’re born human, man, there’s nothing you need to do to reclaim your humanity.

From outside, light pours into the room. Some of the youths groan and cover their faces with their arms, the rest remain completely immobile, dead to the galaxy. A tall man wearing a gas mask, a helmet and full body armour enters the room. With a torch in one hand pressed against the barrel of his gun which is grasped firmly in the other, he scans the room quickly. “Fucking junkies...” he sighs. The long-haired man is seemingly perturbed by this statement, he murmurs slightly louder for a few seconds in the direction of the newcomer before simmering down once more. </p>\n            \n           <div className=\"pageIndicator\"><p>1.</p></div>\n            \n        </div>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function CisTwo() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"contentArea\">\n            <h2>Culture in space</h2>\n            <h2>Chapter 1.</h2>\n            <p>“Is she in there?” a stern, strong voice comes from outside the room.</p>\n            <p>“I don’t see her, sir” the tall man responds. “Just a bunch of societal waste.”</p>\n            <p>“Do you think any of them can talk?” a man peers through the doorway.

He approaches a dilapidated antique armchair in the centre of the room. On the armchair sits a youth, covering his face with his arms and whimpering softly.
